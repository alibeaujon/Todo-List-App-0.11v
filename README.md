# 📝 Todo List App - Python Project

This is a simple command-line Todo List application written in Python. It's one of the first real-world projects from the **60-Day Python Mega Course**, designed to build practical skills through hands-on development.

The goal of this project is to:
- Practice reading and writing files
- Work with Python functions and loops
- Build a basic user interface via the command line
- Handle common programming errors using try/except blocks

## 💻 How It Works

The app allows users to:
- **Add** tasks to a text file
- **Show** the current list of tasks
- **Edit** tasks by their index
- **Mark tasks as complete** (which removes them from the list)
- **Exit** the program gracefully

All tasks are saved to a local file (`todos.txt`) so data persists between sessions.

## 🔍 Features

- File I/O: Read and write to external files
- Input parsing with string methods
- Error handling with `try` and `except`
- Clean and readable CLI output
- Modularized code with reusable functions

## 🧠 Skills Practiced

- Python fundamentals
- Basic file handling
- Control flow
- List manipulation
- Command-line interaction
